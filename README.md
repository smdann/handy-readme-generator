## Installation 

This application uses npm Inquirer 8.2.4 and fs. Inquirer allows for the gathering of information from the user via command-line prompts and fs allows for the writing of the file.

## Usage 

Use of this application allows the user to easily create a professional README.md file for their project. 

First, the user initiates the command-line application by entering 'node index'.

A series of prompts will appear and the user will enter input for each, one after another. The following prompts are included in order to gather information for each section of the README:

* What is the project title?

* Enter a project description.

* Enter installation instructions.

* Enter usage information.

* Enter contribution guidelines.

* Enter test instructions.

* Choose a license for your application. (4 license options display and the user selects 1)

* Enter your GitHub username.

* Enter your email address.

The user's input for each prompt gets populated into the appropriate section of the README file. The sections are easily accessed by clicking the links in the table of contents.

A badge for the type of license chosen will appear at the top of the file and a link to more information about the license will appear in the license section.

In the questions section, there will be a link to the user's GitHub account and a link to send an email to the user.

Please see the tutorial video below for a quick demonstration of how this application works.
